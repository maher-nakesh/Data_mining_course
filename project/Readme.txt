this project to detect Ddos  attack using SVM,KNN
algorithm .
to install:

- download mininet ,a ryu controller frm the link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ggFHKjKwsu7OOlf1t7a8Wl3ESR0YDtNw?usp=sharing

- run the machines on vmware nad be sure they have same ip network(should setup the ip for ryu controller).
-copy data set from  mininet folder on nryu controller and replace Flow file 
-run Dt controller
-runt topolgy.py on mininet
